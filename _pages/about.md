I am a Senior Researcher at <span style="color:#408e8f"><b>CNR-ISTI</b></span> and External Prof. at <span style="color:#9a852e"><b>UNIPI</b></span>.

I am also a member of the <span style="color:#00369f"><b>KDD-lab</b></span>: a joint research team that connects the Computer Science Dept. of the University of Pisa, CNR-ISTI, and SNS.

Within the lab, I coordinate the research activities on <span style="color:#a624a6"><b>Complex Network Analysis</b></span>.

My research focuses on modeling, characterizing and forecast emerging (social) behaviors leveraging complex networks and AI/ML techniques.

My recent research spans over the following topics:
- polluted information environments;
- cognitive network science;
- scholarly migration;
- online mental health.

I am always open to new collaborations and opportunities: feel free to contact me!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
