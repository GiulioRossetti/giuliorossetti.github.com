I am a Senior Researcher at **CNR-ISTI** and External Prof. at **UNIPI**.

I am also a member of the **KDD-lab**: a joint research team that connects the Computer Science Dept. of the University of Pisa, CNR-ISTI, and SNS.

Within the lab, I <u>coordinate</u> the research activity on **Complex Network Analysis**.

My research focuses on modeling, characterizing and forecast emerging (social) behaviors leveraging complex networks and AI/ML techniques.

My recent research spans over the following topics:
- polluted information environments;
- cognitive network science;
- scholarly migration;
- online mental health.

I am always open to new collaborations and opportunities: feel free to contact me!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
